        <p class="para1">I graduated from San Francisco State in 2017 with a bachelors in finance while
                 working at Target as a sales representative for the past four years. My previous experiences include
                 coaching children soccer teams and participating in various volunteer events for the community including 
                 tutoring and environment protection. I love playing soccer, 
                video games, and hanging out with friends.</p>
            
        <p class="para2">Mostly recently, I adopted a hobby of landscape photography by going around the bay
            area with my friends to catch fascinating images of land marks, skylines, or environment 
            to show on Instagram or quick mini videos.
        </p>

        <p class="para3">My interest for technology started when I was about 5 while growing up in Netherlands
            where I started testing with my dad's computer on Microsoft Word and Excel. 
            Since then, my hobby was on beening on computer various hours and being fascinated from every action a 
            key does on the screen. During elemenetary and middle school, my focus was on microsoft programs and then 
            in high school I took my first coding class and inspired me to have a career in a job that involves tech and 
            analytical thinking. My Finance degree and the coding bootcamp is just the start to my career in software and web development.
